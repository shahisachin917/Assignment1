# Recipe app

## In this exercise, we'll update a recipe app to have styled links:

Here's our criteria:

- Main article links should have a color of `deeppink`, with no underline. Hovering will show an underline
- Links in the aside should be black, with an underline. Hovering will hide the underline.
- We should solve this problem by writing new CSS selectors, not by adding new classes to the `<a>` tags. We shouldn't have to modify the `<a>` tags at all.
